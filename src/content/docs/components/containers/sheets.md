Sheets are a transient surface which open from the edge of the screen, presenting contextual content or actions while keeping the underlying page visible for user orientation. This allows for focused yet reversible tasks, such as editing details or viewing information, whilst preserving the user's place in the main workflow.

## Desktop / Side Sheets

Side sheets open from the right side of the screen.

### Anatomy & Structure

Our side sheets have the same consistent structure throughout our platform.

#### Header Elements

- Back Button & Breadcrumbs (left) - breadcrumbs should be truncated to fit within one line
- Tags (left) - inline with Back Button
- Close X Button (top right)
- Heading
- Subheading/Caption

#### Footer Elements

- Always at least one CTA i.e. Close
- Primary CTA (right) e.g. Submit, Apply, Confirm, Next
- Secondary CTA (left) e.g. Back, Previous
- Fixed positioning at bottom of sheet

#### Height & Width

- **Full viewport height**: Spans entire height of screen
  - Remains in a fixed position during scrolling of content
- **By default**, sheet width is fixed at 540px for optimal scannability:
  - 540px width is scientifically proven to be the most readable. Research from leaders like Baymard and Nielsen Norman shows that the ideal line length for reading is 50-75 characters. Using our primary body font Inter at 16px, a 540px width lands us right in the middle of that range at about 60 characters per line. This prevents user fatigue, increases comprehension, and makes our content much more scannable and professional.

#### Scrim & Dismissal

- **Scrim**: Light transparency showing main screen context
- **Dismissal**: Clicking scrim does NOT close sheet. Sheets can only be closed via header X, or completion of final action.

### Navigation Depth

#### 3 Step Maximum Rule

**General Principle**: Limit side sheet navigation to 3 hierarchical levels (or 'steps') maximum. For example:

1. Main Filter Sheet → Category Selection → Date Picker
2. Settings Sheet → Account Preferences → Notification Settings

This prevents users from being lost in deep navigation trees, maintaining the lightweight nature of side sheets.

#### Exit Strategies at Max Depth

- Show clear breadcrumb navigation
- Provide clear X and 'Back' button at every step
- Ensure Primary CTA resolves the user's task

### Input Fields

All form fields function inline, unlike in mobile bottom sheets.

### Form Flows within Side Sheets

Forms (a set of 5 or more input fields with one 'Submit' or equivalent CTA) are exempt from the 3-step rule, but follow specific guidelines.

#### Unlimited Steps for Forms

- **Maximum 5 fields** per form page/screen
- **Progress Indicators**: Always show progress bar for multi-step forms
- **Navigation**: Clear next/back buttons with form validation

'Lightboxes' or similar (e.g. for opening full-size images, data viz) do not count as a 'step'.

A side sheet should have a single primary focus, whilst allowing users to easily exit a flow and/or preserve their initial position or page.

## Mobile / Bottom Sheets

Bottom sheets open from the bottom of the screen.

### Anatomy & Structure

Our bottom sheets have the same consistent structure throughout our platform.

#### Header Elements

- Back Button & Breadcrumbs (left) - breadcrumbs should be truncated to fit within one line
- Tags (left) - inline with Back Button
- Close X Button (top right)
- Heading
- Subheading/Caption

#### Footer Elements

- Always at least one CTA i.e. Close
- Primary CTA (right) e.g. Submit, Apply, Confirm, Next
- Secondary CTA (left) e.g. Back, Previous
- Fixed positioning at bottom of sheet

#### Height & Width

- **Full viewport width**: Spans entire width of screen
- **By default**, sheet height adapts to content naturally
- **Maximum**: Caps at 90% of screen height
- **Minimum**: Never less than 30% for usability

Bottom sheets containing form flows will always open at 90% height. See 'Form Flows within Bottom Sheets' below.

#### Scrim & Dismissal

- **Scrim**: Light transparency showing main screen context
- **Dismissal**: Clicking scrim does NOT close sheet. Sheets can only be closed via header X, or completion of final action. Where possible without conflict, 'Swipe to Close' is enabled but shows confirmation if unsaved changes exist.

### Navigation Depth

#### 3 Step Maximum Rule

**General Principle**: Limit bottom sheet navigation to 3 hierarchical levels (or 'steps') maximum. For example:

1. Main Filter Sheet → Category Selection → Date Picker
2. Settings Sheet → Account Preferences → Notification Settings

This prevents users from being lost in deep navigation trees, maintaining the lightweight nature of bottom sheets.

'Lightboxes' or similar (e.g. for opening full-size images, data viz) do not count as a 'step'.

This 3 Step Maximum rule does **not** apply to bottom sheets containing form flows. See 'Form Flows within Bottom Sheets' below.

#### Exit Strategies at Max Depth

- Show clear breadcrumb navigation
- Provide clear X and 'Back' button at every step
- Ensure Primary CTA resolves the user's task

### Input Entry Sheets

#### 'Standard' Flow

When a user taps a field requiring an overlay or dropdown (e.g. date picker) **from a standard app page**, this will open a dedicated bottom sheet for that specific input. These sheets will be at a responsive height.

1. User opens the main bottom sheet (e.g., 'Filter Results')
2. User taps 'Select Date' inside the sheet
3. The main bottom sheet animates away, and a new, purpose-built 'Date Picker' bottom sheet opens

#### 'In-Sheet' Flow

When a user taps a field requiring an overlay or dropdown (e.g. date picker) **within a bottom sheet**, the current sheet is replaced by a new bottom sheet for that specific input. These sheets will be at max 90% height, as is standard for sheet form flows.

1. User opens the main bottom sheet (e.g., 'Filter Results')
2. User taps 'Select Date' inside the sheet
3. The main bottom sheet animates away, and a new, purpose-built 'Date Picker' bottom sheet opens
4. User enters input and/or navigates back to previous sheet

Here, the new sheet becomes the primary context. User can return to the previous sheet by clicking on the 'Back' CTA in the footer, or click the X in the top-right to completely exit the bottom sheet flow entirely.

### Form Flows within Bottom Sheets

Forms (a set of 5 or more input fields with one 'Submit' or equivalent CTA) are exempt from the 3-step rule and the general height rule, but follow specific guidelines.

#### Unlimited Steps for Forms

- **Maximum 5 fields** per form page/screen
- **Progress Indicators**: Always show progress bar for multi-step forms
- **Navigation**: Clear next/back buttons with form validation

#### Fixed Height for Forms

All bottom sheets containing a form flow open at **fixed 90% screen height** regardless of content length. This includes when a form is broken down to 1-5 fields per 'step'.

This prevents jarring height changes between form steps, maintains consistent header and footer CTA positioning, and provides uniform user experience throughout form completion.

#### Implementation Details

- Animate to 90% height immediately upon opening
- Maintain consistent height between steps (except for 'Input Entry Sheets' which are responsive), adjust internal content only
- Accommodate errors without height changes

A bottom sheet should have a single primary focus, whilst allowing users to easily exit a flow and/or preserve their initial position or page.

If a user needs to perform a secondary, complex task (like choosing a date), that task also deserves its own dedicated space. The Input Entry pattern above honours this principle best, providing a clean, intuitive, and predictable experience for the user.
